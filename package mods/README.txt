################################## HOW TO

This mod will add to your skimage library the definition of a new local adaptive
thresholding algorithm (Singh et al. [1]), two new (slower) versions of already
implemented local adaptive thresholding algorithms (Niblack "slow", Sauvola "slow" in order to perform control test(speed and quality)).

substitute the files in C:/user/.../skimage/filter
                        /User/.../skimage/filter
	with those (homonyms) contained in this "package mods".
